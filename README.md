# 2048

A clone of the game 2048 I created with basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It can be played online [here](https://pcotestudio.github.io/2048/).

### Rules

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the cells towards a direction. Cells containing the same number will combine once they clash, raising the score. A new number spawns every move and you lose when the board is full with no move/combination possible.
